# sBTC Enhancement Project

## Overview
The sBTC Enhancement Project aims to improve Bitcoin-Stacks interoperability by developing smart contracts that enhance the usability of sBTC (Stacks Bitcoin). This project provides automated features for wrapping/unwrapping BTC, atomic swaps, and implements security measures for safer Bitcoin transactions on the Stacks blockchain.

## Project Goals
- Simplify the process of wrapping and unwrapping BTC into sBTC
- Enable atomic swaps between STX and BTC
- Create incentive mechanisms for liquidity providers
- Implement time-locked recovery systems
- Position Stacks as a reliable Bitcoin Layer 2 solution

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
The project consists of the following main components:
- Core sBTC wrapping/unwrapping contract
- Atomic swap functionality
- Liquidity provider incentive system
- Time-locked recovery mechanisms

### Prerequisites
- Clarity CLI
- Node.js v14 or higher
- Stacks blockchain local development environment
- Bitcoin node (for testing)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sbtc-enhancement.git
cd sbtc-enhancement
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start local Stacks blockchain:
```bash
clarinet integrate
```

### Contract Deployment

1. Configure your deployment settings in `Clarinet.toml`

2. Deploy the contract:
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## Smart Contract Functions

### Core Functions

#### initialize-wrap
Initiates the BTC to sBTC wrapping process.
```clarity
(define-public (initialize-wrap (btc-tx-hash (buff 32)) (amount uint)))
```

#### complete-wrap
Completes the wrapping process after BTC confirmation.
```clarity
(define-public (complete-wrap (btc-tx-hash (buff 32))))
```

#### initiate-unwrap
Starts the unwrapping process from sBTC to BTC.
```clarity
(define-public (initiate-unwrap (amount uint)))
```

### Administrative Functions

#### set-minimum-wrap-amount
Allows contract owner to set minimum wrap amount.
```clarity
(define-public (set-minimum-wrap-amount (new-amount uint)))
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Security Considerations
- Minimum amount restrictions to prevent dust attacks
- Owner-only administrative functions
- Balance checks for all operations
- Pending wrap verification system

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current)
- Basic wrapping/unwrapping functionality
- User balance management
- Administrative controls

### Phase 2 (Current)
- Atomic swap implementation between STX and sBTC
- Comprehensive swap lifecycle management
- Timeout and cancellation mechanisms
- Enhanced security measures for swap operations
- Rate calculation framework (prepared for oracle integration)

### Phase 3
- Liquidity provider incentives
- Advanced error handling

### Phase 4
- Time-locked recovery system
- Event notification system

### Phase 5
- Performance optimizations
- Additional security enhancements
